# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our projects seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Bedlessbot or the Official Bedless Nation Website, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

To report a vulnerability, please use GitHub's private security reporting feature:

1. Go to our [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/MesterMan03/Bedlessbot/security/advisories/new).
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, potential impact, and any other relevant information.

## Handling Vulnerability Reports

Once a vulnerability report is submitted, our team will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report as soon as possible.
2. Review the report and validate the vulnerability.
3. Collaborate with the reporter to understand the issue and determine the appropriate course of action.
4. Address the vulnerability and release any necessary patches or updates.
5. Credit the reporter for their responsible disclosure, if they wish to be acknowledged.

## Thank You
